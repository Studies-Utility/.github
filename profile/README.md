## About Studies
Studies is a powerful, beautifully designed flashcard application built for serious learners. It transforms the simple concept of flashcards into a dynamic and highly effective learning system by leveraging the scientifically proven Spaced Repetition System (SRS). Instead of cramming, Studies intelligently manages your review schedule, presenting cards you struggle with more frequently and spacing out those you know well. This method maximizes retention while minimizing total study time, making it ideal for mastering languages, preparing for exams, or learning complex technical subjects.

The application goes far beyond simple text-on-card functionality. You can build rich, multimedia flashcards—perfect for adding pronunciation audio to language cards, diagrams to anatomy studies, or chemical structures to chemistry decks. Its library organization allows you to structure decks hierarchically (e.g., Subject > Chapter > Topic). With robust statistics, study reminders, and seamless iCloud sync across Mac, iPad, and iPhone, Studies provides a complete, professional-grade learning environment that grows with you, from high school exams to lifelong self-education.
